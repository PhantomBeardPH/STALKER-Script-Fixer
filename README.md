# STALKER Auto Fixer üõ†Ô∏è

An automatic Lua/LTX error patcher for major **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** modpacks like **GAMMA**, **EFP**, **Radiophobia 3**, and **Anomaly Anthalogy 2.0 OBT**.

This tool scans your `gamedata` folder (or full mod directory), detects risky script patterns, and applies safe auto-fixes to help prevent crashes. It comes with a drag-and-drop GUI, live scan status, and full logging/backup support.

## üîß Features

‚úÖ Drag-and-drop GUI for folders or files  
‚úÖ Checkbox to scan **entire gamedata** or just recently modified files  
‚úÖ Supports `.script`, `.ltx`, `.ini`, `.xml`, and `.txt` files  
‚úÖ Live list of scanned files shown during scan  
‚úÖ Safe auto-wraps for Lua functions like `r_nvg.toggle_nightvision`, `actor:give_info_portion()`  
‚úÖ **Auto backup** with versioned timestamps (before any changes)  
‚úÖ **SHA-256 log and patch integrity check**  
‚úÖ Threaded scanning (no freezing)  
‚úÖ Revert all changes with cancel button  
‚úÖ Auto-saves logs to `stalkerscriptsfixer logs/`  
‚úÖ Option to open logs in Notepad or Notepad++  
‚úÖ Open-source, community-rule friendly (`fix_rules.json`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The tool:

1. Scans `.script`, `.ltx`, `.ini`, `.xml`, and `.txt` files in `gamedata` or entire mod directory  
2. Looks for known **risky Lua or LTX functions** (customizable via `fix_rules.json`)  
3. Auto-wraps with safe `if type(...) == "function"` guards  
4. Creates timestamped `.bak` versions of every edited file  
5. Displays live progress in GUI  
6. Saves logs with scan results, file paths, and backups  

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### Drag-and-Drop Mode (Recommended)

1. Run `StalkerScriptFixer.exe`  
2. Drag your **`gamedata` folder** or **entire mod directory** onto the window  
3. Check `Scan Entire Gamedata` if needed  
4. Click `Start Scan`  
5. Monitor live progress, or click `Cancel & Revert` at any time

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Where Are Backups and Logs Stored?

- üîô **Backups**:  
  Saved to a separate `backups/` folder (not inside `gamedata`)  
  e.g., `backups/2025-07-25_18-40-15/scripts/broken.script.bak`

- üìù **Logs**:  
  All scans saved to `stalkerscriptsfixer logs/scan_log.txt`  
  Older logs and backup logs go to `stalkerscriptsfixer logs/old logs/`

- üßæ **Open Logs**:
  After scan, click `Open Log` to view it in Notepad or Notepad++ (if installed)

---

## üîê Integrity Check
