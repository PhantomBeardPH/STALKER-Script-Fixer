# STALKER Auto Fixer üõ†Ô∏è

An automatic script error patcher for major **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.** modpacks like **GAMMA**, **EFP**, and **Anthalogy 2.0 OBT**.

It scans your `gamedata` folder for modified `.script`, `.ltx`, `.ini`, `.xml`, and `.txt` files and wraps **risky function calls** with safety checks. The tool helps prevent fatal engine crashes and ensures smoother gameplay even after modding or tweaking files.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Detects and scans recently modified files
- ‚úÖ Auto-wraps vulnerable Lua calls like `r_nvg.toggle_nightvision`
- ‚úÖ Works with most major STALKER modpacks
- ‚úÖ Creates automatic `.bak` backups before patching
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and uses very little RAM
- ‚úÖ Open source and modder-friendly

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This script automatically:
1. Scans recent files in your `gamedata` folder.
2. Looks for known risky function calls (e.g., night vision toggles, missing inventory handlers).
3. Wraps them in safe `if type(...) == "function"` checks to prevent nil crashes.
4. Backs up any changed file before fixing.

üöÄ Usage
python stalker_fixer.py /path/to/gamedata
--This will recursively scan and fix script/config files in the target folder.

üì¶ Supported Mods (and growing):
-GAMMA (Anomaly-based)
-EFP (Expanded Factions Project)
-STALKER Anthalogy 2.0+ OBT

 üß† Modder Tips:
Place this tool in your root STALKER mod directory

Run it after every mod install or script change

Use version control (like Git) to track changes

Do not run it blindly if you manually wrote complex Lua logic ‚Äî always review changes

üíæ Low RAM Usage
This script:

Avoids loading massive files in memory

Skips files over 5MB

Uses generator-style iteration

Ideal for low-spec machines and older PCs used for modding

üìÅ Where are backups saved?
NOTE: Backups are saved in the same folder as the original file, with a .bak extension added to the filename.

‚úÖ Example:
If the original script is:

Copy
Edit
gamedata\scripts\some_script.script
Then the backup file will be:

Copy
Edit
gamedata\scripts\some_script.script.bak
This ensures:

The backup stays next to the file it protects.

You can manually compare, restore, or delete the .bak file anytime.
