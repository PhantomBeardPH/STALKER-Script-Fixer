# üíª Implementation Guidelines

üß† Adding New Features

1.) For UI:
  # Example: Adding a new button
///
  self.new_feature_button = ttk.Button(button_frame, 
                                   text="New Feature",
                                   command=self.new_feature_method)
  self.new_feature_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=5)
///

2.) For Script Fixes:
  # Example: Adding a New LTX Fix rule
///
  if file_path.endswith('.ltx'):
    # New fix: ensure no trailing whitespace
    original_content = content
    content = "\n".join(line.rstrip() for line in content.splitlines())
    if content != original_content:
        fixes.append("Removed trailing whitespace")
///

3.) For New Mod Support:

///
# 1. Add to SUPPORTED_GAMES
SUPPORTED_GAMES = [..., "New Mod Name"]

# 2. Add to GameVersion enum
class GameVersion(Enum):
    NEW_MOD = "New Mod Name"

# 3. Add mod-specific fixes
if self.settings.game_version == "New Mod Name":
    # Add mod-specific fixes here
///

# üì¶ Distribution Requirements

       If you distribute a modified version:
    1. Clearly state it's a modified version
    2. Include a link to the original project
    3. Keep all original warnings and disclaimers
    4. Do not charge money for the modified version
    5. Provide your contact information for support
    
# üìù Best Practices

       Versioning: Use your own version scheme (e.g., "Community Edition v1.0")
    1. Documentation: Clearly document your changes in a CHANGELOG.md
    2. Testing: Thoroughly test all modifications before distribution
    3. Attribution: Credit both the original author and your contributions
    4. Compatibility: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
    
# üöß SUPPORT BOUNDARIES

       The original author is not responsible for supporting modified versions
    1. Community support should be clearly distinguished from official support
    2. Modified versions should provide their own support channels

# üí° Example Modding Scenario

       Goal: Add support for "Lost Alpha" mod
    1. Add to supported games:
ex.
///
  python
SUPPORTED_GAMES = [..., "Lost Alpha"]
///

    2. Add to GameVersion enum:

///
class GameVersion(Enum):
    LOST_ALPHA = "Lost Alpha"
///

    3. Add specific fixes:
    
///
if self.settings.game_version == "Lost Alpha":
    if file_path.endswith('.ltx'):
        # Lost Alpha specific LTX fixes
        if "[la_section]" in content:
            content = content.replace("[la_section]", "[lostalpha_section]")
            fixes.append("LA section rename")
/// -- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to test thoroughly and document your changes!
